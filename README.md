# DeaLynx Chrome Extension (Frontend & Integration)

This directory contains the front-end Chrome Extension for the DeaLynx prospect intelligence workspace. The extension injects a right-hand panel that connects to a FastAPI backend, which in turn triggers a Make.com automation workflow for email generation.

## Current Capabilities

* Fixed right-hand workspace (now in a glassy dark theme) that can be collapsed or reopened.
* **Single-Button Analysis:** Captures the entire page and sends it to the FastAPI backend.
* **Automated Email Drafting:** Triggers a Make.com workflow to analyze the prospect and create a personalized email draft in your Gmail, all from a single click.
* **Report Layout:** Shows skeleton placeholders while waiting for the backend/AI response to render sections.
* **Chat Panel:** Streams prompts to a stubbed `/chat` endpoint and displays typing indicators.

## Installing the Extension Locally

1.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
3.  Click **Load unpacked** and select the `chrome-extension` directory from this repository.
4.  Pin the DeaLynx extension to your toolbar for quick access.
5.  Open any web page (LinkedIn profiles are a good starting point) and click the extension icon. The right-hand workspace should slide in automatically.

## Using the Workspace

1.  Click **Analyse**. The extension will capture the page content and send it to the backend (`http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{id}/analyze`).
2.  The panel shows a loader while it requests the report. When the backend replies, the report sections will animate in.
3.  **Check your Gmail "Drafts" folder.** Simultaneously, a personalized email, generated by the AI and processed by our Make.com automation, will be ready for your review.
4.  Use the **Chat** input to send prompts to `/sessions/{id}/chat`.

## Backend and Automation Workflow

This project's "backend" is a hybrid of a FastAPI server (for AI processing) and a Make.com automation (for email delivery).

All network calls are centralized at the top of `contentScript.js`. The `API_BASE_URL` constant should point to your live FastAPI deployment (e.g., on Render).

The end-to-end flow works like this:

1.  **Chrome Extension:** The user clicks "Analyse." The `contentScript.js` sends the scraped page content (URL, text, etc.) to the FastAPI backend.
2.  **FastAPI (Backend):** The backend receives the raw data. It then calls the **Google Gemini AI** agent with a specific prompt, instructing it to analyze the prospect and return a structured JSON object containing a `subject` and `body`.
3.  **Make.com (Automation Layer):** The FastAPI backend takes this JSON and immediately sends it as a payload to a secure **Make.com Webhook**.
4.  **Email Generation (Gmail):** The Make.com scenario (which we have built) triggers:
    * It receives the payload.
    * A **Text parser** module cleans the AI's output.
    * A **JSON** module parses the clean text.
    * A **Gmail** module maps the `subject` and `body` fields to a new draft email in your connected account.

This entire pipeline allows the user to get a fully drafted, personalized email ready for review in seconds, just by clicking one button.

## Next Integration Steps

* Connect the live FastAPI `/analyze` endpoint to the Make.com webhook URL to complete the automated email drafting flow.
* Persist session/capture identifiers so the backend can resume in-progress work.
* Replace the offline chat generator with the real conversational agent.
