# DeaLynx: Prospect Intelligence Assistant

## 1. Problem Statement

More than **90% of sales calls and outreach messages end in rejection**.  
The issue is not that the product lacks value, but that salespeople often sell what they believe is right instead of focusing on what the **customer truly wants or expects**.

Most outreach today is **generic and assumption-based**. Sales representatives send templated messages and product decks that fail to connect with the customer’s real motivations.  
Modern buyers expect **relevance**. They want to feel **understood, valued, and approached with context**.

### In Reality
- Only **32% of sales outreach** is truly personalized.  
- Personalized communication can **increase response rates by two to three times**, but teams struggle to scale it.  
- Representatives spend **20 to 30 minutes researching each prospect**, yet most messages still sound impersonal.

This lack of personalization leads to:
- Low engagement  
- Longer sales cycles  
- Missed opportunities  

Sales teams talk about what they *think* matters, while customers respond to what *actually* matters to them.

## 2. Solution Overview

**DeaLynx** helps salespeople personalize outreach with context drawn directly from their prospects’ digital presence.  

It is built as a **Chrome Extension** connected to a **FastAPI backend**, with AI agents built using the **Google ADK framework**.  
DeaLynx captures information about a prospect, analyzes it, and presents a clear summary and suggestions that support more relevant outreach.

## 3. Technical Solution

### Overview
DeaLynx consists of three main parts:
1. A Chrome Extension for capturing screens and displaying insights.  
2. A FastAPI backend for handling communication and data processing.  
3. An agent layer built with the Google ADK framework for generating insights, summaries, and outreach suggestions.

### 1. Chrome Extension (Frontend)

The Chrome Extension acts as the user’s workspace.

**Process:**
1. When a sales representative opens a prospect’s profile (for example, on LinkedIn or a company website), DeaLynx starts a **session**.  
2. It captures the **visible screen** and identifies elements such as:  
   - Name, title, and company  
   - About or summary section  
   - Recent posts or activity  
   - Skills, achievements, and featured projects  
3. The user can navigate to additional pages related to the same prospect (for example, a company page or personal website).  
4. DeaLynx captures these additional screens as part of the same session.  
5. Once the necessary screens are captured, the data is sent to the **FastAPI backend** for analysis.  

After analysis, a **Prospect Report** is displayed in the extension next to a **chat input area** that allows the user to interact with the DeaLynx AI agent.

### 2. Prospect Report

The Prospect Report summarizes the information collected during the session in a structured layout.  
It is generated automatically by the AI agent and displayed in the Chrome Extension.

**Recommended Report Sections:**

1. **Profile Overview**
   - Name, role, company, and industry  
   - Current position and key responsibilities  
   - Professional summary

   - Possible business challenges or priorities  

5. **Communication Style**

   - Preferred content style  

6. **Outreach Suggestions**

### 3. Chat Interface with the AI Agent

Next to the report, a chat interface allows the user to explore the insights further by asking questions or generating new content.

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Understanding context**
  - “What does this person focus on professionally?”  
  - “What are their top areas of expertise?”  
- **Creating outreach**
  - “Write an introduction message for this prospect.”  
  - “Generate a short email with a friendly tone.”  
- **Summarizing or refining**
  - “Summarize their recent activity.”  
  - “List the top three topics they seem interested in.”  

The chat experience allows real-time exploration of insights and message refinement directly inside the extension.

### 4. FastAPI Backend

The backend acts as a bridge between the Chrome Extension and the AI agent layer.

**Functions:**
- Receives the data captured from each session.  
- Extracts and prepares the text and metadata for analysis.  
- Sends requests to the Google ADK-based AI agents for processing.  
- Collects the output and sends the generated report and insights back to the extension.  
- Handles authentication, logging, and request management.

---

### 5. AI Agent Layer (Google ADK Framework)

DeaLynx uses agents built with the Google ADK framework to process and generate insights.

**Agents:**
- **Data Extraction Agent:** Filters and organizes useful information from captured screens.  
- **Insight Agent:** Identifies themes, tone, focus areas, and engagement topics.  
- **Personalization Agent:** Generates outreach examples, summaries, and actionable suggestions.  
- **Conversational Agent:** Manages user chat input and provides interactive responses about the report.

Each agent operates independently but communicates context through the ADK framework.

---

### 6. Data Flow Summary

1. The Chrome Extension captures one or more screens from a session.  
2. The captured data is sent securely to the FastAPI backend.  
3. The backend processes the data and sends it to the AI agents for analysis.  
4. The agents generate the report and responses.  
5. The final report and chat content are returned to the Chrome Extension for display.

---

### 7. Security and Privacy

- Only user-authorized, publicly available data is collected.  
- All communication between the Chrome Extension and backend uses **HTTPS encryption**.  
- Authentication uses **OAuth2 and JWT tokens**.  
- Data handling follows privacy standards similar to **GDPR** compliance.
